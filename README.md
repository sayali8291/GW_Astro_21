# **Gravitational Wave Astrophysics**

#### University of Potsdam, Master of Astrophyiscs, Summer Semester 2021



Gravitational waves from merging black holes were observed for the first time in 2015, opening a new window to observe the Universe.  This course gives a broad overview of the emergent field of gravitational wave astrophysics.  Topics covered:  the theory of gravitational waves; astrophysical objects that create gravitational waves (most notably black holes and neutron stars); gravitational wave modeling; current and future gravitational wave detectors, both on Earth and in space; survey of the gravitational wave observations to date, and their implications on our understanding of the universe and fundamental physics.



Lectures:  Tuesdays, 8:15 - 10:00  (starting April 13)

Ãœbungen:  Mondays, 8:15-10:00  (starting April 19, every other week in *even* calendar weeks)



***Due to the covid-19 restrictions, the course will be held on-line via Zoom.  Connection information will be emailed to students who have contacted the instructor to signal their interest.***



Lecturer: Prof. Harald Pfeiffer,  harald.pfeiffer@aei.mpg.de, Albert-Einstein-Institute.  Online office hour on request.

TA:  Niko Wittek, nikolas.wittek@aei.mpg.de, Albert-Einstein-Institute.  Online office hour on request.





#### Course aims:

- **Give an overview of the current observational results of gravitational wave detectors.**  This is dominated by LIGO and Virgo's observations of binary black hole mergers and binary neutron star mergers.  However, we will also touch on LIGO/Virgo observations of other GW sources and on observations by pulsar timing arrays and the cosmic microwave background.
- **Connect the observational results to the underlying physical processes:**  Why do the LIGO/Virgo results look the way they do?  What does this tell us about the universe and fundamental physics?
- **Give a flavour of the theory and of the calculations that underpin gravitational wave astronomy:**  Theoretical treatment of gravitational radiation.  Properties of black holes and Neutron stars.  Calculation of waveform templates with post-Newtonian theory and numerical relativity.  Parameter estimation. 
- **Teach some Python:**  A lot of the characteristic features of black holes, neutron stars and binaries can be explored by solving ordinary differential equations.  Solving and exploring those ordinary differential equations in python is faster and more fun than solving them analytically.



#### Prerequisites

- Introductory knowledge of General Relativity, on the level of  "Introduction to General Relativity and Cosmology":   Metric tensor, field equations, rudimentary knowledge of Schwarzschild solution and Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology.
- Rudimentary Python knowledge.  In particular how to develop and execute simple programs, and some plotting experience.  



#### Suggested Literature

- James Hartle, **Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity,** Pearson Education. 
- possibly: Michele Maggiore, **Gravitational Waves, Volume I and II**, Oxford University Press.

The level of the course is at the high end of Hartle (e.g. we will follow Hartle's last few chapters on the theory of gravitational waves), and therefore, Hartle is strongly recommended.  

Volume II of Maggiore is the only current book that discusses the first GW observations.  However, these two volumes are *much more* comprehensive and advanced, and we will use them only for some specialized topics.  While the Maggiore books are important for students specializing in gravitational waves, they are pricey and the course will only cover a small fraction of them.  I will try to point out publicly accessible alternatives when possible.

Many other introductory text-books to general relativity exist, among them:

- Sean Caroll, **Spacetime and Geometry** (also available at https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/spacetimeandgeometry/)
- Hobson, Efstathiou, Lasenby, **General Relativity: An Introduction for Physicists**

These books were written before the 'GW revolution', so they don't cover GW observations.



#### Course web-site

We use the git-repository
https://git.aei.mpg.de/hpfeiffer/GWAstro2021, which should be publicly accessible either through a web-browser or through git.

The repo already contains a detailed [course outline](https://git.aei.mpg.de/hpfeiffer/GWAstro2021/blob/master/Syllabus.md).  Lecture notes will be uploaded before each class.  Problem sets will also be made available through the repository.

Please contact the lecturer or TA if you have difficulty to access the repository.



#### Grading

- There will be problem sets and an oral exam.  To be admitted to the exam, **at least 50% of the points on the problem sets must be achieved**.



#### Problem set policy

- It is ok to discuss problems with other students or the TA.  The ultimate execution of the work (write-up, python programs) must be your own.
- Solutions & python programs to be emailed to Niko at the assigned due-date.

- Late hand-in of problem sets is  ***only*** accepted after arrangement with the TA or Lecturer ***ahead*** of the due-date.
